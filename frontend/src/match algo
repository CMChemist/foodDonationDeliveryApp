##Start this process after user-item join
1.X filter all items for the one that match the newDonation
2.X filter all items' users for the ones that are food banks
3. save to const needFoodBanks and sort so in order of closest
   food bank to furthest away.
4. filter all driver's locations that are in range of donor
5. save to const possibleDrivers
6. check distance for each possibleDrivers' location to each 
   needFoodBanks
7. From this return an array of objects the object of the food bank
   and the distance from driver location
8. filter these arrays for object containing distances that are
   outside the driver's milesFrom
9. Remove from possibleDrivers any driver whose array of distance
   objects is empty after filter
10. The array of food bank distances should still be in the same
    closest to furthest from the donor order, so return the object
    in the 0 index location as the match.
11. Return each of the drivers left with their match food bank
12. Save the matches to the match table.
13. Each associated with these matches should have these matches
    displayed on their profile.
14. A button should be on the driver's profile so they can accept
    the delivery.
15. Matches show be displayed on the map page as well.
16. (Stretch) Once one driver accepts, it should disappear from the other
    drivers' profiles.
